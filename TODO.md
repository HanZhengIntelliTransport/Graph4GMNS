```

Below is an explanation of each directory/file:

---

## 1. **`simplegraph/` package**

This is the main package that will contain all the core functionality of your custom graph system.

1. **`__init__.py`**  
   - Makes the directory a Python package.
   - You can optionally import or expose classes/functions here (e.g., `from .graph import SimpleGraph`) so that users can do `from simplegraph import SimpleGraph` directly.

2. **`graph.py`**  
   - Contains your `SimpleGraph` class and any additional classes or helper functions specific to graph structure or node/edge management (e.g., advanced node/edge attribute handling).
   - In other words, it’s your core data model for the graph.

3. **`algorithms.py`**  
   - Houses algorithms like DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, etc.
   - You can group them under one file, or create submodules for more advanced algorithms (e.g., `shortest_paths.py`, `centrality.py`, `flow.py`, etc.) if your project grows.

---

## 2. **`tests/`**

Unit tests and integration tests live here.  
- **`test_graph.py`**  
  - Tests the functionality of `SimpleGraph` (e.g., adding and removing nodes/edges, checking attributes).  

- **`test_algorithms.py`**  
  - Tests all algorithm functions (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, etc.).  

Adopt a testing framework like **pytest** (commonly used) or **unittest** (in the Python standard library). This helps ensure your codebase is robust and maintainable.

---

## 3. **`examples/`**

Demo or usage scripts. These are not part of the library per se, but show how to use it in real scenarios.  
- **`example_usage.py`**  
  - Example script that imports your `SimpleGraph`, creates a small graph, runs algorithms, prints results, etc.  

---

## 4. **`setup.py`**

If you plan to distribute your library or make it easily installable (`pip install .`), you can include a `setup.py` file using **setuptools**. For example:

```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name="simplegraph",
    version="0.1.0",
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=[
        # e.g., "numpy>=1.18.0"
    ],
    python_requires=">=3.7",
    description="A simple graph management system",
    author="Your Name",
    author_email="you@example.com",
    url="https://github.com/yourusername/simplegraph",
    classifiers=[
        "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
        "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
        "Operating System :: OS Independent",
    ],
)
```

If you don’t plan to distribute your project as a library, you can skip this and just keep your code organized in folders.

---

## 5. **`requirements.txt`**

A simple text file listing external dependencies (if any). For instance, if you want to use `pytest` for testing, you could have:

```
pytest==7.0.0
```

Add any libraries your project depends on. If you don’t rely on external packages (besides the standard library), you can keep it blank or omit the file entirely.

---

## 6. **`README.md`**

A markdown file with a short description of the project, instructions for installation, usage examples, and anything else people might need to get started.

- **Example**:
  ```markdown
  # SimpleGraph

  A minimal, GMNS-oriented library for managing graphs in Python.

  ## Features
  - Directed/undirected graphs
  - Node and edge attributes
  - Common graph algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra)

  ## Installation
  ```
  ```bash
  # Install in editable mode
  pip install -e .
  ```

  ```markdown
  ## Usage

  ```python
  from simplegraph import SimpleGraph
  from simplegraph.algorithms import bfs, dfs, dijkstra
  # ...
  ```
  ```

---

## Putting It All Together

1. **File-by-file**:

   - `graph.py`:  
     Contains your `SimpleGraph` (or `DirectedGraph`, `UndirectedGraph`) classes and methods like `add_node`, `add_edge`, etc.
     
   - `algorithms.py`:  
     Contains functions `dfs(graph, start)`, `bfs(graph, start)`, `dijkstra(graph, start)`, etc.

2. **Imports**:
   - In `example_usage.py`, do something like:
     ```python
     from simplegraph.graph import SimpleGraph
     from simplegraph.algorithms import dfs, bfs, dijkstra

     def main():
         # create a graph
         g = SimpleGraph(directed=False)
         g.add_node("A")
         g.add_node("B")
         g.add_edge("A", "B", weight=5)

         # run BFS
         visited = bfs(g, "A")
         print("BFS visited:", visited)

         # run Dijkstra
         dist = dijkstra(g, "A")
         print("Shortest distances from A:", dist)

     if __name__ == "__main__":
         main()
     ```

3. **Testing**:
   - In `test_graph.py`, you might have:
     ```python
     import pytest
     from simplegraph.graph import SimpleGraph

     def test_add_node():
         g = SimpleGraph()
         g.add_node("A")
         assert "A" in g.nodes()
     ```
   - In `test_algorithms.py`, you might have:
     ```python
     import pytest
     from simplegraph.graph import SimpleGraph
     from simplegraph.algorithms import bfs

     def test_bfs():
         g = SimpleGraph()
         g.add_edge("A", "B")
         visited = bfs(g, "A")
         assert visited == {"A", "B"}
     ```

Run tests with `pytest`:
```bash
pytest tests
```
